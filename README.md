# bigquery_mysql_connection
Create an ETL job with python. The python file has to retrieve data from BigQuery piece by piece (10k, 100k, etc.) Data can be stored in any relational (MySQL.) databases on the locale. o The file contains two date parameters: batch and realtime. 'batchâ€™ parameter should get the past data and write to a database as fast as possible. Please, measure its time and improve the performance (Hint: Parallel Processing). realtime parameter should get the last day. o The file has to be robust in terms of logging and try-except mechanisms (DBs connections, etc.).
